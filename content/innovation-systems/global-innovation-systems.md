Hypothetical global innovation system (GIS) in healthcare (Binz and Truffer, 2017).

# Introduction to GIS

While Binz, Truffer and Coenen (2014) highlight the possibility to utilize TIS for an international analysis without setting a priori territorial boundaries, in Binz and Truffer (2017) the authors propose a new framework to capture technological innovation processes in transnational contexts building on multi-scalar concepts of innovation systems that provides heuristics for an empirically informed comparative analysis that has been lacking from innovation literature.
The concept is based on interconnected multi-national subsystems with two key mechanisms: generation of resources and establishment of structural couplings and four generic GIS configurations are proposed that are differentiated on the background of a technological innovation dimension and a product valuation dimension that result in the following categorizations: I) Footloose GIS, II) Market anchored GIS, III) Spatially sticky GIS, IV) Product anchored GIS (Binz and Truffer, 2017).
