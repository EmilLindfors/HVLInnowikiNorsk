The components of an innovation system are the actors, networks and institutions (Carlsson and Stankiewicz, 1991). Innovation systems are analytical tools to understand system dynamics and interaction between components that may be unplanned or unintentional as the actors are not necessarily orchestrated to work toward the same goal. The actors, networks and institutions are modelled as a coherent system at a higher abstract level, and there are multiple such abstractions depending on the classification of the innovation system, such as national innovation systems (Freeman, 1987), regional innovation systems (Aasheim and Isaksen, 1997), sectoral innovation systems (Malerba, 2002), technological innovation systems (Carlsson and Stankiewicz, 1991) and most recently global innovation systems (Binz and Truffer, 2018).

# Global Innovation systems

While Binz, Truffer and Coenen (2014) highlight the possibility to utilize TIS for an international analysis without setting a priori territorial boundaries, in Binz and Truffer (2017) the authors propose a new framework to capture technological innovation processes in transnational contexts building on multi-scalar concepts of innovation systems that provides heuristics for an empirically informed comparative analysis that has been lacking from innovation literature.
The concept is based on interconnected multi-national subsystems with two key mechanisms: generation of resources and establishment of structural couplings and four generic GIS configurations are proposed that are differentiated on the background of a technological innovation dimension and a product valuation dimension that result in the following categorizations: I) Footloose GIS, II) Market anchored GIS, III) Spatially sticky GIS, IV) Product anchored GIS (Binz and Truffer, 2017).

# Technological Innovation Systems

TIS has become a popular approach to innovation process analysis that can be defined as: “a set of networks of actors and institutions that jointly interact in a specific technological field and contribute to the generation, diffusion and utilization of variants of a new technology and/or a new product” (Markard and Truffer, 2008). A distinct feature of a TIS is the absence of territorial boundaries which allows for analysis of technology on a global scale which Binz, Truffer, Coenen (2014) utilize to connect how innovation processes may interrelate in unrelated places. Bergerek et al (2008) proposes a model for analysis where the structures and functions of a TIS are in focus and describes a step-wise analysis consisting of: 1) Definition of TIS in focus, 2) Identifying the structural components of the TIS, 3) Mapping the functional pattern of the TIS, 4) Assess the functionality of the TIS and set process goals 5) Identify inducement and blocking mechanisms, 6) specify key policy issues.
There are several choices to be made when defining the TIS in focus, Bergerek et al (2008) outlines three choices 1) knowledge field or product as a focusing device, (2) choice between breadth and depth and (3) choice of spatial domain. The focus of the PhD will be on a knowledge field as the examined technologies all are applied in processes to produce nearly identical products. The choice of going for breadth instead of depth will yield a dataset that is suitable for an exploratory review of similarities and differences which in turn though a TIS and GIS lens can connect several spatial domains into one innovation system.
